        <h1>J.A.R.V.I.S.</h1>
          <p><em>Just A Rather Very Intelligent System</em></p>
          <p>Equipment Used: <a style="color: black; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs">Soon...</a></p>
          <p>I saw <a style="color: black; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MstrJames">Hacksmith</a> and <a style="color: black; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyps7stAwVshGUGYhpY-Jiw">Braden Smith</a> made a JARVIS system so I wanted to as well. I was originally going to follow how Hacksmith did theirs with OpenHAB, but I decided to go a different route since I didn't want OpenHAB eating up an entire Raspberry Pi.</p>
          <p>The first goal I wanted to accomplish was a simple on/off plug switch. After doing a couple days of research, I figured out a relay system is what I needed. I learned about ESP8266s and eventually landed on a tutorial by <a style="color: black; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ortNaZnlDEc">MK-SmartHouse</a> That's where I decided to go the Sonoff route.</p> 
          <p>Funny enough, MK's design was almost exactly how I wanted mine to be in my head, except I wanted the female connector to be flush with the box. I'm not going to go into detail how I make the system, you can go watch his four part video series on the entire process. The only part that was different for me was what controlled it.</p>
          <p>Since I want to be able to use a Raspberry Pi and not have anything flashed on it such as OpenHabian, I made my own control interface. I named it the JARVIS Brain. It is run on python scripts that communicate with a MQTT server hosted on the Pi. Along with that I made a website using PHP and a MySQL database to manage the on/off switch interface. There was still one more part though. I wanted voice control similar to Amazon Alexa or Google Home. So I made another python script utilizing Speech Recognition, pyttsx3, and PyAudio. I am currently waiting for a USB microphone and speaker to finalize testing. The script listens for certain words using Google Speech Recognition API and if it reads a certain string of words such as "turn on the lights" it runs a command. So I can literally say anything before and after as long as I say turn on the lights in that sentence. It's kind of a sneaky trick to make it seem like my JARVIS can understand different greetings such as JARVIS, Hey JARVIS or even Yo J.</p>
          <p>I am currently finalizing the design for my Sonoffs, or "JARVIS receivers", to sit in. The only difference I have is I don't trust the connector so I am planning to solder the external wire between the Sonoff and extension cord ends.</p>

        <h1>Iron Man</h1>
          <p><em>“Iron Man. That’s kind of catchy. It’s got a nice ring to it. I mean it’s not technically accurate. The suit’s a gold titanium alloy, but it’s kind of provocative, the imagery anyway.” – Tony Stark (Iron Man)</em></p>
          <p style="float: right;"><em>July 17, 2020</em></p>
        <h2>Iron Man MK6 Hand</h2>
          <p>File Used: <a style="color: black; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1623321">Iron Man MK6 MK 6 Glove Hand with repulsor</a></p>
          <p>This went rather south from the beginning... The original files were too close for my printer's settings (however at the time of writing this I have gone back and optimized them) so after the second finger I separated the joints to add more space between them. That fixed some stringing issues.</p>
          <p>After that, printing went smooth. I didn't sand as much as I probably should have, but I just went with it. I went with new paint I saw online for iron man and it wasn't as accurate as I thought. During the painting process I ran into a bunch of issues with holes and the object falling over.</p>
          <p>Since I'm starting a MK3 Iron Man helmet, I think I have the colors on lock this time and am planning to print out another hand... this time going up to the elbow. In the end, I don't mind having props to fill my display spaces :)</p>

          <p><em>It's still printing...</em></p>
          <!--<p>Just like in the Star Wars prop making world, I found someone who "specilized" in Iron Man props.
